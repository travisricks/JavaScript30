      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array REFERENCE, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); // copies an array

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread (takes every item out of your iterable and puts it into the new container)
      const team4 = [...players];

      // Array.form
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread - this is available as of ECMAScript 2018
